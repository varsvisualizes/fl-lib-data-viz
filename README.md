# Florida Library Data Visualizations

Experimentations in data visualization using data about Florida library systems. Made as a part of my mentorship project for June 2025.

The purpose of this project is to build my skills in data analysis, data visualization and app development.

Honestly, I'm just obsessed with future-proofing my career prospects. I have a job I love, but I still have more I want to learn and accomplish. I hope that by building projects like this one, I'll develop my skillset and open up doors to future opportunities in tech and art in libraries & cultural institutions.
